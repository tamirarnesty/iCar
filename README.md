# iCar
iCar is the intelligent, Arduino powered car that follows a path indicated by a black line on a white surface.
The car must complete the complex circuit in under 1 minute and 45 seconds, while performing many 90째 turns, 180째 turns as well
as an even more challenging 45째/135째 turn around a corner.
The iCar is powered by an Arduino, using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and LEDs to determine the direction it must go.
The entire project is self-coded and designed with partners Dewmi Seneviratna and Cameron Quan-Yin.
